Welcome to Computational Molecular Modeling Laboratory supervised by Prof. Rakwoo Chang, Department of Applied Chemistry, University of Seoul, Republic of Korea.

 

Our research goal is to understand interesting physical and biological phenomena using various computer simulation techniques such as Molecular Dynamics, Monte Carlo, and Brownian Dynamics simulations.

 

Current research projects include organic photovoltaic cells, lithium-ion batteries, nanoparticles on biological membranes, structural behavior of neurofilaments, polymer dynamics in confined geometry, and etc.
